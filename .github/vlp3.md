## Data Analysis & Insights
Write a short analysis of your findings. Include at least one interesting insight from your data.

> _Example:_ “We found that many who selected their least favorite restaurant selected that they ate there 0 times per month which was to be expected. The favorite restaurants were very divided but the least favorite restaurants had some unity with McDonalds”

## Reflection
Answer briefly:
- What went well in your project? "Compiling the data was the easiest part"
- What was the most challenging part? "Making the charts because of the somewhat limited options"
- If you had more time, what would you do differently? "I would probably change the survey a little bit by removing the option for people to write in their own restaurant."
